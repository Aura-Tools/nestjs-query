## Queries

The `core` package defines a `Query` type that is used by the `query-typeorm` and `nestjs-query`.

The query interface contains three optional fields

* `filter` - option to filter records.
* `paging` - option to page records.
* `sorting` - option to sort records.

To read more about queries take a look at the [typeorm query](../typeorm/query) docs.

## Services

The `core` package defines a `QueryService` interface that has the following methods.

* `query` - find multiple records.
* `findById` - find a record by its id.
* `getById` - get a record by its id or return a rejected promise with a NotFound error.
* `createMany` - create multiple records.
* `createOne` - create one record.
* `updateMany` - update many records.
* `updateOne` - update a single record.
* `deleteMany` - delete multiple records.
* `deleteOne` - delete a single record.

The `@nestjs-query/query-typeorm` package defines a base class `TypeormQueryService` that uses a `typeorm` repository
to create and execute queries. [Read about the TypeormQueryService](../guides/typeorm)

You can create your own service as long as it implements the `QueryService` interface.

## Resolvers

### CRUDResolver

Resolvers work the same as they do in [`@nestjs/graphql`](https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/resolvers-map). The only
difference is you extend `CRUDResolver` which will add a base set of CRUD methods.

**Queries**

* `todoItems` - Find multiple `TodoItem`s.
* `todoItem` - Find one `TodoItem`. This method still takes query arguments however it will will only find one record.

**Mutations**

* `createManyTodoItems` - create multiple `TodoItems`.
* `createOneTodoItems` - create one `TodoItem`.
* `updateManyTodoItems` - update multiple `TodoItems`.
* `updateOneTodoItems` - update one `TodoItem`.
* `deleteManyTodoItems` - delete multiple `TodoItems`.
* `deleteOneTodoItems` - delete one `TodoItem`.
