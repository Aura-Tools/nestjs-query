## Relation decorators

In versions prior to `v3.0.0` the relation decorators had `disableRemove: true` and `disableUpdate: true` as default,
from `v3.0.0` and onward this behavior will now be opt-in instead of opt-out.

### Old

The old `@Relation` with update and remove disabled would look like this

```ts
@Relation('todoItem', () => TodoItem, {
  disableUpdate: true,
  disableRemove: true
})
```

### New

```ts
@Relation('todoItem', () => TodoItem)
```
